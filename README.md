### Error encountered for frontend file not being tracked by github
   Create a .gitignore in the "frontend" Folder:
If none of the above steps solve the problem, try creating a .gitignore file within the "frontend" folder and make sure it is empty (no patterns or entries). This might force Git to recognize and track the contents of the "frontend" folder.

Navigate to the "frontend" folder and create an empty .gitignore file:

bash

Copy code

```touch .gitignore```

Then try to commit and push the "frontend" folder again.
