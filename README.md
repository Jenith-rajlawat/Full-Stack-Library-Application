## Things to consider before
- You are free to use this research as a reference and make modifications to continue your own research in Nepali ASR. 
- The `trainer.py` has been implemented to run on the sampled data for now. To replicate the result please replace dataset directory with original [OpenSLR dataset.](https://openslr.org/54)
- Please remove the (audio, text) pairs that include Devnagari numeric texts like १४२३, ५९२, etc from the dataset because they degrade the performance of the model.

## Documentation for my error
   Create a .gitignore in the "frontend" Folder:
If none of the above steps solve the problem, try creating a .gitignore file within the "frontend" folder and make sure it is empty (no patterns or entries). This might force Git to recognize and track the contents of the "frontend" folder.

Navigate to the "frontend" folder and create an empty .gitignore file:

bash
Copy code
touch .gitignore
Then try to commit and push the "frontend" folder again.
