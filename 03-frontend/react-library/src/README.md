# Bootstrap classes (Documentation)
## Navbar
navbar: This is the base class for creating a navigation bar in Bootstrap. It sets up the basic styling and structure for the navbar.

navbar-expand-lg: This class specifies how the navbar behaves when the screen size changes. In this case, it indicates that the navbar should expand (show the navigation links) when the screen width is equal to or greater than the "lg" (large) breakpoint.

navbar-dark: This class sets the color scheme for the navbar. It makes the background dark, and the text color is light. You can use navbar-light for a light background with dark text.

maincolor: This is a custom class that you've applied. It's not a standard Bootstrap class, so its appearance depends on how it's defined in your custom CSS or elsewhere in your project.

py-3: This class is used to add padding to the top and bottom of the navbar. py-3 adds padding on the y-axis (top and bottom) with a value of 3. It's part of Bootstrap's spacing utility classes.
